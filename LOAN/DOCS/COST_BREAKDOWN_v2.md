## Addendum (English, concise)

- Clarify scope: Customer record and loan status are managed directly in the Dealer Admin Portal (source of truth), not via lend.com.au.
- New capability: Brokers can update customer profiles and change loan status (e.g., Active ‚Üí Paid‚Äëoff) within the portal.
- Data export: Support exports by status (All/Active/Paid‚Äëoff) and by broker or all brokers.
- Notifications: ‚ÄúRequest for statement‚Äù notifies brokers; status updates trigger in‚Äëapp/push alerts to customers.

---

## üîí Scope Alignment with Requirements (Concise)

- Source of truth: Customer and loan data are mastered in the Dealer Admin Portal; mobile app integrates and reflects portal updates in real time.
- MVP Core (Phase 1): Authentication, Dashboard (Home), Loan Application & Approval, Repayment Schedule, Repayment Reminder, Push Notifications, Broker Worklist & Filtering, Assignment, Customer Data Management, Loan Status Update, Data Export.
- Phase 2 (Enhancements): Admin Panel, Wallet/Balance view, Advanced reporting, Enhanced notifications, Performance optimizations.

### Currency & Units
- Infrastructure costs: priced in USD (approximate, monthly/annual as listed above).
- Development: priced in AUD (see Budget & Phasing; milestones table also in AUD).

### Development Budget & Phasing (AUD)

| Phase   | Scope (summary)                                                                 | Budget (AUD) |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | MVP Core features listed above                                                   | 2,400        |
| Phase 2 | Core completion checkpoints (workflows, integration hooks, 50% progress)        | 800          |
| Phase 3 | Advanced & finalization (reminders, admin essentials, export, QA, deploy)       | 800          |

Total Development Budget (MVP): 4,000 AUD

### Key Non-Functional Requirements (from Requirements Document)
- Performance: App launch < 3s, page load < 2s, API < 1s, exports < 30s; real-time updates < 5s.
- Security: End-to-end encryption, secure APIs, RBAC, MFA for sensitive ops, full audit logs.
- Scalability & Reliability: ‚â•1,000 concurrent users (MVP), 99.5% uptime target, robust sync with portal.
- Integration: Real-time synchronization with Dealer Admin Portal; conflict resolution and retries.

### Assumptions
- Continuous access to Dealer Admin Portal APIs for real-time sync and updates.
- Notification services (Firebase/Email/SMS) credentials provided and configured by partner where needed.
- Data export requirements limited to CSV/Excel by status (All/Active/Paid-off) and by broker/all brokers.

### Out of Scope (for current cost and MVP)
- Document upload/management, advanced document workflows.
- Wallet/payment processing and settlement flows.
- Complex reporting beyond basic exports and listed Phase 2 enhancements.
