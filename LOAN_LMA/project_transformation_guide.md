  final double value;
  // Implementation...
}

class CreditScore {
  final int value;
  // Implementation...
}

class LoanTerm {
  final int months;
  // Implementation...
}
```

  static const String creditScore = '/api/v1/credit-score';
}
```

#### 6.2 Data Models
```dart
// New data models
class LoanModel {
  final String id;
  final String customerId;
  final double amount;
  final double interestRate;
  final int termMonths;
  final String status;
  // Implementation...
}

class LoanApplicationModel {
  final String id;
  final String customerId;
