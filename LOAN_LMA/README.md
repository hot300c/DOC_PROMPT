## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Review Project Overview
Start by reading `project_overview_example.mdc` to understand:
- Project architecture and patterns
- Domain models and business logic
- Infrastructure components
- Key workflows and data flows

### 2. Understand Implementation Rules
Read `implementation_rule.mdc` to learn:
- Development workflow and standards
- Coding conventions and best practices
- Task implementation guidelines
- Quality assurance processes

### 3. Plan Your Features
Use `break_down_rule.mdc` to:
- Break down complex features into manageable tasks
- Create comprehensive task checklists
- Identify dependencies and priorities
- Ensure complete feature coverage

### 4. Set Up Project Structure
Follow `project_template_structure.md` to:
- Create the proper directory structure
- Set up core configuration files
- Implement domain entities and value objects
- Configure routing and state management

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Clean Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer** (`lib/domain/`)
   - Business entities (Loan, Customer, Payment)
   - Repository interfaces
   - Use cases and business logic
   - Value objects (Money, InterestRate, CreditScore)

2. **Data Layer** (`lib/data/`)
   - Repository implementations
   - API services and local data sources
   - Data models and DTOs
   - Caching and offline support

3. **Presentation Layer** (`lib/presentation/`)
   - GetX controllers for state management
   - UI pages and widgets
   - Dependency injection bindings
   - Route management

### Key Design Patterns

- **MVVM with GetX**: Reactive state management
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access
- **Dependency Injection**: Service management
- **Value Objects**: Type safety for business concepts
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulated business logic

## 📋 Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login
- Social authentication (Google, Apple)
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Role-based access control

### 2. Customer Management
- Customer profile creation and management
- Identity verification
- Credit scoring and history
- Document management
- Address and contact information

### 3. Loan Management
- Loan application submission
- Application status tracking
- Loan approval workflow
- Loan terms and conditions
- Interest rate calculations

### 4. Payment Processing
- Payment scheduling and reminders
- Multiple payment methods
- Payment history tracking
- Late payment handling
- Payment confirmation

### 5. Document Management
- Document upload and storage
- Document verification
- Document templates
- Digital signatures
- Document sharing
